javaChat
========

An extremely basic java chat.  Allows multiple clients in a single chat room.  

Essentially ripped from: http://pirate.shu.edu/~wachsmut/Teaching/CSAS2214/Virtual/Lectures/chat-client-server.html

Server takes a port number as a command line argument

Client takes a host name and port number as command line arguments
